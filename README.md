# Shiny_App_Project
Shiny App Project using Heart Failure Clinical Records data for NYC Data Science Academy September 2020 Part-Time Bootcamp
- Special thanks to the instructors and TAs!



This Shiny App compares several factors affecting heart disease patients (mainly between sexes).

The 3 files used with RStudio are:
  - global.R
  - ui.R
  - server.R
 
The pre-cleaned dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data/
